# Shell

This project is part of the module federation project. It is a sample application for module federation integration.

# Steps to run the app

1. run "npm i" in the cmd/node terminal. // It will install the angular packages in the node_modules folder.
2. run "ng s " in the cmd/node terminal. // It will run the application on http://localhost:5000.

You can run the Module-Federation-mfe1 from my other repository. Once you run the app, it can render the child application inside it by hitting the travel tab in the header.
